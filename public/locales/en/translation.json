  "introducing": "Hey! 👋 I AM MATHEUS",
  "description": "Passionate about programming since the age of 15, where I started with games like 'code combat', I am a Brazilian born in 2003. I currently study Software Engineering and work as a Software Developer at the largest aircraft manufacturer in Latin America. I love challenges, especially those that force me out of my comfort zone, because I believe that it is in these moments that I evolve and learn the most. I'm a dedicated student, a lover of e-sports and, in my spare time, I like to share knowledge on social media. I'm also a geek/anime enthusiast and a gym lover 💪🏻🚀.",
